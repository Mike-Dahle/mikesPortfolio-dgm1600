                <h2 class="header-two">The Problem</h2>
                <p>Many People have an intuitive understanding of modern day technology that is only surface level. You might have heard of file extension names like .mp3 or .mpeg, but what do they mean? who created them and why? What are the different capabilities of the many file types we use for photos and when should you use a .png over a .jpeg? These are things that most people don’t think about. For my project at Utah Valley University I set out to gain a deeper understanding of the technology we use everyday. And I needed to deliver that information in a technical document that an average person could learn from.</p>

              <h2 class="header-two">The Process</h2>
              <p>To create this document I needed to research in-depth, topics related to audio, images, videos, device specifications, and many other things related to these topics. I also looked into the file formats that are related to these topics as well. Each type of media has various file types associated with them, and they all have positives and negatives. The point of this document is to gain a better understanding of these technologies and pass that on to my readers in a digestible and visual form. With how large the scope of this document was, I had to split it up into sections so that the content was more manageable for both me and the reader. Something I’d like to point out is that this document is by no means an all inclusive document. I merely scratched the surface to gain a better understanding, and maybe inspire some research in my readers as well.</p>

            <h2 class="header-two">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>What I enjoyed about this process is that I got to learn so much about the technology that surrounds us. And a lot of the information I have within this document will be relevant to my career in web development. I think the most valuable information I picked up was about the various file formats for each type of media. When you start to understand that they are not all created equal and that some of them excel where others fall short. You are able to capitalize on their strengths within your own projects. I think it was also a great exercise in finding credible information. A lot of the time its hard to know if what you are reading is verified information or not. Its unfortunate that the people who invented the many things contained in my document didn't see a need to maintain official information pertaining to their creation. Overall, I now have a information dense document that i can refer to when i have questions of my own in the future. And that in its self is worth a lot.</p>

                <h2 class="header-two">The Problem</h2>
                <p>The Editor’s Assistant website suffers from a user interface that is outdated and un-usable. When you are greeted with the login page what you will see does not inspire confidence. For a website that aspires to be a center for educational content you would hope to see something that adheres to modern day standards. The login page was the first thing I wanted to tackle when it came to re-designing their website. When a user navigates to your website you want the first thing they see to clearly communicate what you want them to do. And if what they see is poorly designed they might not even feel comfortable interacting with it.</p>

            <h2 class="header-two">The Process</h2>
            <p>A lot of my focus was directed towards standardizing major components within the website. I created a navigation bar that stays consistent throughout the whole site so that you can easily navigate back to your profile or the home page. And also as I mentioned before the login page needed a lot of work. For the login page I wanted to make something standard that you would see commonly among better designed websites. Its clean, un-cluttered, and things are organized in a way that helps the user complete their task easier. When it comes to the other pages, this website is very text heavy and I wanted to keep everything minimalistic and organized to help reduce any strain on the user. I also made a very recognizable link in the navigation bar that will expand to show you all the options you have for navigating your own profile. I used some of the color scheme that I created. But again, I didn't want to oversaturate this website with colors and other distracting elements. This is an educational website and the focus needs to be on the content.</p>

            <h2 class="header-two">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>It’s important to follow a process when approaching any design work. You can’t just skip ahead to creating the final product. The choices you make for each component and each page need inspiration and meaning. You aren’t going to get that from haphazardly throwing content on a page. Sketches help you think of possibilities that you can incorporate, while wirefreames help you to boil those possibilities down into a foundational design. Once you have that foundation that’s when you can get into creating the indentity for your design in prototyping. And all these steps when followed will help to create a better experience for the user. Which in the end is what matters most!</p>

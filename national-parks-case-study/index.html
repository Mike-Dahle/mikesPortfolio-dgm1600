                <h2 class="header-two">Pick a National Park</h2>
                <p>For this project I was challenged to pick any National Park and build an app for it. The challenge was open ended with no real requirements, other than to build an app for a National Park of my choice. It needs to have a function related to the park that I choose, the user interface needs to be intuitive, and I needed to build a prototype for it. For my park I decided to go with the Redwoods National Park. I have always loved seeing the pictures of the massive trees and it is one of the few National Parks that I actually know. Now that I have my park selected I need to figure out what it is that my app is going to do.</p>

            <h2 class="header-two">My Process</h2>
            <p>I wanted my app design to be a one stop shop for visitors of the Redwoods National Park. To accomplish this I needed to make it so that my users could do everything from downloading trail maps, reserving camp grounds, live weather and emergency notifications, and a place to view general information about the park and its natural inhabitants. I also knew that I wanted to add a gamification function into the app to encourage people to keep coming back to the park and my app. I accomplished this by attaching a trophy system to the trails within the Redwoods. Users would have the ability to scan a QR code at the end of each trail which would give them credit for completing the trail. With a complete plan for my app I went to work designing and prototyping each screen to show how each of these functions would look like on a device.</p>

              <h2 class="header-two">Conclusion</h2>
              <p>I am very satisfied with the resulting app that I have created. I feel like it accomplishes all the things that I set out to do when I first envisioned my National Park app. Users are now able to reserve a campsite and pay for their reservation all within the app. Users will also now be able to navigate trails online and offline, as well as earn trophies for completing each trail that they can brag about to their friends and family. There is also a page where they can see general information about the park and view the trophies that they have earned. This app offers users two crucial functions, camp reservations & trail maps. Just these two things add a lot of value to the visitors of Redwoods National Park, making their stay easy and fun. </p>

          <p>You will find my full Figma prototype below. Some of the elements are not functional, I have only built out certain pages to show what each function would look like.</p>

                <h2 class="header-two">The Problem</h2>
                <p>Feit Electric’s Mobile App lacks the professional appearance and experience that users would expect from an application they would use to control all of their smart home devices. The buttons look clunky and outdated, it lacks any sort of cohesive color theme or identity. There are some sections of the app that also have unintentional bugs with the appearance of menu items. And all of this lends itself to the feeling that this is not a great company.</p>

            <h2 class="header-two">The Process</h2>
            <p>Because I am doing this project on my own I unfortunately do not have access to all the tools and information I would like to do a proper redesign. Things like stakeholder interviews, customer surveys & interviews, and other things that would help me fully understand the problems this app has. That being the case, I started with some competitive research or “mood boards” to understand what it was that the Feit Electric App was missing when compared to their competitors. Once I had an understanding of the concepts they lacked, I moved on to sketching and wireframing to put my ideas on paper. With my newly designed interface I needed to give the app a clearer identity. I chose a color scheme using Adobe’s Color software, and I combined that with components from the IBM Carbon Design System. These two together helped to give the app a sleek foundation for its interface and some color to solidify their identity.</p>

            <h2 class="header-two">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The Feit Electric App has a lot of useful functionality but one of its main issues is that it looks and feels like it was developed and designed only by software engineers. Sure, they had all the buttons there to give you that functionality the user wanted. But none of it helped to communicate to the user what they were looking at. Visually the entire App is pretty hard to look at. The user interface looks like it was designed for the release of the Apple’s first IPhone back in 2007. After working through this process, I believe I have created an interface that pulls their app back into the present. It has inspiration pulled from some of the biggest tech companies available and components from professionals like IBM. </p>

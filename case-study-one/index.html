                <h2 class="header-two">The Problem</h2>
                <p>The AOL Mail Application is still running on dial up when it comes to its user interface and user experience. Chances are that if you are looking to sign up for an email account you will end up at one of its competitors like Microsoft Outlook or Google’s Gmail, and for a good reason. Aol’s interface is hard to navigate, aesthetically displeasing, and not user friendly. This is where I come in.</p>

            <h2 class="header-two">The Process</h2>
            <p>Firstly I needed to collect some examples of what Aol’s competitors were doing. Mail services like Outlook and Gmail are great examples of good user interface design and functionality. After collecting examples from these services I had some ideas for how I wanted to restructure the user experience at Aol. I went on to create some sketches to visualize possible changes I could bring to the applications user experience. Proceeding that, I solidified my design by taking what I liked the most from my sketches and combining them to create wireframes. My wireframes gave me the base with which I could focus an the color scheme, visual heirarchy and other important elements to create a prototype of my design.</p>

            <h2 class="header-two">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>It’s important to follow a process when approaching any design work. You can’t just skip ahead to creating the final product. The choices you make for each component and each page need inspiration and meaning. You aren’t going to get that from haphazardly throwing content on a page. Sketches help you think of possibilities that you can incorporate, while wirefreames help you to boil those possibilities down into a foundational design. Once you have that foundation that’s when you can get into creating the indentity for your design in prototyping. And all these steps when followed will help to create a better experience for the user. Which in the end is what matters most!</p>

          <p>
            Restaurant menus are pretty boring. They haven't changed much over the years
            other than when some restaurants needed to use QR code menus during the height
            of the pandemic. Usually when you go out to eat at a restaurant you will get handed
            a menu that is largely text based and maybe has a few pictures to give you an idea of
            what the food looks like. But other than that they are pretty boring most of the time.
            That got me thinking, what if you could see more than just static pictures on your menu?
            What if you could use your phone to bring your menu to life!?

        <h2 class="header-two">The Process</h2>
        <p>
          For this project I needed to use a website called Zapworks. It is a pretty cool
          concept that would be perfect for this project. Zapworks allows you to create Zap codes
          which you can then attach to digital or print based products and then your customers can
          use Zapworks Zappar App to scan a custom QR code and interact with an augmented reality
          experience that you create on their website. Now originally I thought it would be really
          amazing if I could figure out a way to either model or scan each of the dishes that has a
          code next to it. That way you could scan a code for tonkotsu ramen and see the dish appear
          on your menu with augmented reality. Unfortunately I dont have the technical skills for that yet. So, I had to
          settle on making slideshows and videos which you can view and interact with on your phone.

            I believe the original concept I had envisioned has a lot of potential. Imagine how cool it would be to see a 3D render of the food you want to order before you order it. The AR experience I was able to create at my current experience level fell short of my own expectations. But that mostly comes down to my inexperience with the software itself. But with all of that said, I want to leave you with one of my favorite AR experiences that I have seen. The video included here is a AR billboard being used to advertise the new Resident Evil show.

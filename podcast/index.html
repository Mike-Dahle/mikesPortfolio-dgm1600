        <p>Welcome to my podcast called Loremasters. This is a podcast that I did as an assignment for my Digital Media 2260 class at Utah Valley University. The goal of this podcast was to create a professional sounding and looking podcast from the ground up; Utilizing the information we learned about podcasting in this course. We each chose a topic we are interested in and then created two episodes of a podcast pertaining to that topic.</p>

    <h2>Production Process</h2>

    <div id="production">
        <p>Because I don't have access to a professional setup with a soundproof room and professional grade microphones I had to improvise a little bit. But the cool thing is, I think that the podcast sounds pretty good considering what I used. Each episode was recorded in one take on my 2015 Macbook Pro. I used the DAW software Ableton to record the audio. But the equipment I used was just my laptops microphone. I did have the benefit of a moderately sound insulated room as well, complements of my schools music facilities.</p>

    <h2>Testing & Editing</h2>

    <p id="intro">Each episode before I would start the actual recording I would take test recordings to make sure that everything was working and sounded correct. Once I was satisfied with how things sounded I would then record the entire episode in one take. I actually didn't feel like I needed cut out or change any of the audio afterwards, which was convenient. That's not to say that the audio you hear on the podcast is the raw input. I went into Ableton after recording and made sure to EQ the vocals, add a Drum Buss, and then I also used a filter to warm up the low frequencies. (the macbook above shows an actual screenshot of my recording if you are curious what it looks like.)</p>

    <h2>Publishing</h2>

    <p id="intro">This podcast has been published on Soundcloud. I chose to publish it initially on Soundcloud because I have previous experience using their website. While more popular apps and websites exist like Spotify or Apple Music I though it would be a good idea to stick to what I know at the moment.
